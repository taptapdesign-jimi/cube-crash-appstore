## 🎯 Key Changes

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Game State Save on Exit ✅
**Problem:** When exiting mid-game, progress wasn't being saved properly.  
**Fix:** Added `saveGameState()` call in `exitToMenu()` function before animations start.  
**Impact:** Players can now properly save and resume their games.

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// src/main.ts:402-411
// CRITICAL: Save game state BEFORE animations
try {
  if (typeof window.saveGameState === 'function') {
    console.log('💾 Saving game state before exit...');
    window.saveGameState();
    console.log('✅ Game state saved before exit');
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Failed to save game state during exit:', error);
}
```

#### 2. User Move Flag After Continue ✅
**Problem:** After clicking "Continue" on saved game, subsequent moves weren't triggering save.  
**Fix:** Set `window._userMadeMove = true` after loading saved game state.  
**Impact:** Progress made after continuing a game is now properly saved.

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// src/modules/app-core.ts:2643-2645
// CRITICAL: Set _userMadeMove flag to true after loading saved game
// This ensures that any future moves after Continue will trigger save
window._userMadeMove = true;
console.log('✅ Set _userMadeMove = true after loading saved game state');
```

### 🧹 Code Cleanup

#### 3. Removed Excessive Logging
**Removed:** Ghost placeholder visibility console.log statements throughout `app-core.ts`.  
**Impact:** Cleaner console logs, easier debugging.  
**Files Changed:** `src/modules/app-core.ts` (multiple locations)

#### 4. Added Debug Logging for Save State
**Added:** Detailed logging in `saveGameState()` to track:
- `boardNumber`
- `_userMadeMove` flag
- `_gameHasEnded` flag
- `score`
- `tilesCount`

**Impact:** Better debugging of save/load issues.
