# Cube Crash - Stability Report

## ✅ Verzija
**v7** (Built successfully, deployed to GitHub)

## 🔧 Build Status
- **Build**: ✅ PASSES (2.83s)
- **Type Checking**: ⚠️ 396 TypeScript errors (non-critical, runtime works)
- **Production Bundle**: 187.59 kB main + 511.16 kB vendor (gzipped: 50.75 kB + 145.32 kB)

## 🎮 Core Game Flow Status

### ✅ Working Features
1. **New Game**: Play → Start fresh game ✅
2. **Save Progress**: Merge/stack → Auto-save ✅
3. **Continue Game**: Resume modal → Load saved state ✅
4. **Exit → Menu**: Board/HUD exit animation ✅
5. **Restart**: Restart button → Clean reset ✅
6. **Portrait Lock**: iOS + Web enforced ✅
7. **Board Size**: iPad 6x8, Mobile 5x9 ✅
8. **Animations**: Tile spawn, HUD drop, slider enter/exit ✅
9. **Collectibles**: Screen with dev buttons ✅
10. **Stats**: High score tracking ✅

### ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **TypeScript Errors**: 396 type errors (don't affect runtime)
   - Mostly `implicitly has type 'any'` errors
   - Missing type definitions for PIXI objects
   - Window global property extensions

2. **CSS Warning**: Unexpected "}" syntax error in stylesheet
   - Doesn't affect rendering

3. **Dynamic Import Warning**: `resume-sheet-animations.ts` double-import
   - Functionality works, optimization warning

## 🔒 Critical Safety Features

### Memory Management ✅
- GSAP animation cleanup on exit/restart
- PIXI app destruction on cleanup
- Smoke bubble cleanup
- Ghost placeholder management
- Event listener removal

### Error Handling ✅
- Try-catch blocks around critical operations
- Fallback behavior for failed operations
- Corrupted save file detection
- 24-hour save expiration
- Null reference guards

### State Synchronization ✅
- `saveGameState()` called on:
  - Every merge (drag-core.ts:401)
  - Every move (drag-core.ts:401)
  - Exit to menu (main.ts:406)
  - Visibility change (app-core.ts:2878)
  - Page hide (app-core.ts:2877)
- `loadGameState()` verifies:
  - Save file exists
  - Save file is valid JSON
  - Save is < 24 hours old
  - App is booted

## 🧪 Recommended Testing

### Priority 1: Critical Paths
1. ✅ New game → Play → Make moves → Exit → Continue → Verify progress
2. ✅ Complete board → Level up → Save → Exit → Continue → Verify level
3. ✅ Exit mid-game → Restart → Play → Verify fresh start
4. ✅ Hard exit (kill app) → Reopen → Verify resume option

### Priority 2: Edge Cases
1. ⚠️ Multiple rapid exits (test guard flags)
2. ⚠️ Save while animations playing
3. ⚠️ Low memory scenario on iOS
4. ⚠️ Network issues (PWA offline mode)

### Priority 3: Device-Specific
1. ✅ iPhone 13 (portrait lock)
2. ⚠️ iPad (6x8 board layout)
3. ⚠️ Older iPhones (memory constraints)
4. ⚠️ Android devices

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Build Metrics
- Main bundle: 187.59 kB (50.75 kB gzipped)
- Vendor bundle: 511.16 kB (145.32 kB gzipped)
- Total CSS: 98.17 kB (16.02 kB gzipped)
- Build time: 2.83s

### Runtime Metrics (To Test)
- FPS during gameplay
- Memory usage on iOS
- Battery drain
- Load time (first paint)

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### High Priority
1. Fix TypeScript errors (add proper types)
2. Fix CSS syntax warning
3. Add unit tests for save/load logic
4. Add E2E tests for critical flows

### Medium Priority
1. Code splitting for collectibles (lazy load)
2. Optimize vendor bundle size
3. Add error tracking (Sentry/Crashlytics)
4. Add analytics for user behavior

### Low Priority
1. Refactor ghost placeholder logic
2. Consolidate animation cleanup
3. Remove old working files
4. Document architecture

## ✅ Production Readiness

### App Store Submission Checklist
- [x] Core gameplay working
- [x] Save/load functionality stable
- [x] Portrait orientation locked
- [x] No critical crashes
- [x] Build succeeds
- [ ] Memory leaks resolved (test on physical devices)
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Error tracking in place
- [ ] Analytics implemented
- [ ] Privacy policy updated
- [ ] Terms of service updated
- [ ] Screenshots prepared
- [ ] App description written

### Current Assessment
**Status**: ✅ **STABLE FOR TESTING**

The application is functionally stable and ready for:
- Internal testing on iOS devices
- Beta testing with TestFlight
- Performance profiling
- Memory leak detection

**Not Ready For**:
- Public App Store release (needs polish)
- Production without monitoring (needs error tracking)

## 🔍 Files to Watch

### Critical for Stability
- `src/modules/app-core.ts` - Main game logic
- `src/main.ts` - Entry point, exit flow
- `src/modules/drag-core.ts` - User input
- `src/modules/end-run-modal.ts` - Exit logic

### Potential Issues
- Type errors don't prevent runtime but should be fixed
- Memory management needs thorough testing on iOS
- Rapid interaction edge cases need verification
